## RustDT release ChangeLog

### (NextVersion)
 * Added editor number syntax highlighting. (#55)
 * Fixed: Unindent (Shift-Tab) broken, does nothing after empty lines in selection.
 

### 0.3.0
 * Added support for Build Targets, based on Cargo build targets.
   * Available Build Targets are displayed in the Project Explorer.  You can configure which targets are enabled or not for a workspace build. Or run/debug a specific target.
   * Top-level Build Targets are: `crate#no-tests` and `crate#tests`. You can run/debug specific Cargo binaries or tests from the context menu of the Build Targets.
   * Added Project Build Configuration property page to configure Build Target options.
 * Added specific Project Explorer icons for Rust crate elements: the `src`, `test`, `target` folders; the `Cargo.toml` file.
 * Added Project Explorer element with Cargo dependency references.
 * Added: launch shortcut for a Rust project and Rust integration tests. This is a quick way to create a launch from the Project Explorer context-menu, by selecting either a project, or a Rust test source file in `tests/`, and selecting "Run As" or "Debug As".
 * Added new [Configuration](documentation/UserGuide.md#configuration) section in the User Guide. (#46)
 * Added UserGuide note about using Homebrew GDB in OS X.

Fixes:

 * Fixed: if build tool reports many error messages, the Eclipse project build will take too long to finish. (#26)
 * Fixed: Properly parse Racer "END" line syntax, don't show error when this occurs. (#57)
 * Fixed: when invoking Rust tools like Cargo, add tool directory to beginning of PATH, not end. (#59)
 * Fixed: Don't show error dialog when Racer fails. Only the editor status line is updated now. (#41)
